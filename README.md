## Acknowledgments

For transparency, I would like to acknowledge the assistance I received during the development of this project. Javadoc comments and automated tests were mostly generated by OpenAI's ChatGPT, although I made modifications to ensure accuracy. ChatGPT was also used to debug and optimize the code and move the project forward. While I worked independently to find solutions, I did collaborate with other students on occasion, but mostly to assist them with their code.
